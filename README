This is my first attempt at creating a VIM colorscheme, well forget about that color part: this is monochrome only!

Monolicous does not differ much from the default monochrome scheme, however, the amount of underline attribute, and the reverse attribute at the top when using tabs has been significantly reduced since these imho tend to steal focus from the text.

The motivation for making this monochrome scheme was to make the code view text-only while still providing highlightning of error messages and syntax warnings and notifications.

This scheme still has a few underline attributes at various places, but mostly it relies on reverse attributes to mark up some code parts.

A bit of inspiration came from: http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/index.php
